# subglacialhydro-surges-karakoram

This repository contains code, parametrization files, and data used in simulating seasonal evolution of subglacial hydrology at Shishper Glacier, Pakistan. The code implements SHAKTI (https://issm.jpl.nasa.gov/documentation/hydrologyshakti/), the Subglacial Hydrology And Transient, Kinetic Interactions within the ISSM framework (https://issm.jpl.nasa.gov/). The Exp directory contains the glacier shape used by ISSM and Par contains additional model parameters for running in ISSM. The Data directory contains the glacier surface (TanDEM-X) and bed topography (Millan et al. 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00885-z) used for modeling the glacier, as well as the melt and precipitation data we used to force the model.

Transient model runs can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/194cttkrvqquztehpp2ke/AKVxr2lycWTG8Nvr7t3H3aM?rlkey=3npd1aaxql2jhs0i56otjv9tk&dl=0
